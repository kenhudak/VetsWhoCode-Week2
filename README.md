Site Palette Favorite Site...

In this exercise I realized I really hated the UX on the sites I really love. See: The Atlantic, Reddit, Weather.gov.

Two sites made the cut. One is from the Crypto world, which really seems to be putting in some development effort (perhaps to cover up other shortcomings in their product??). But I have been toying around with the Mysterium Network's Peer to Peer VPN and their colors are slick:

And secondly, Formula 1's site is simple enough and easy to navigate. But when broken down by the color palettes it really looks hideous and like something in the AOL era.
